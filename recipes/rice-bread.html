    <h2>Desription</h2>
    <p>Easy bread for snacks.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>170g short grain white rice (raw)</li>
        <li>20g coconut oil</li>
        <li>12g maple syrup</li>
        <li>3g salt</li>
        <li>3g instant yeast</li>
        <li>110ml water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash rice and soak for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain rice thoroughly and transfer to a high speed blender along with all the ingredients, except instant yeast.</li>
        <li>Blend mixture on high for 1 minute, pause and scrape down the sides. Then blend again for 1 minute and pause to scrape again. Do this 2-3 times until the mixture is completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Add instant yeast to blender and blend on low until combined.  Pour batter into a lightly greased nonstick bread tin. Cover with a moistened tea towel and let rest in a warm place (eg. inside the microwave with a cup of hot water next to it) for 20 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C / 355°F about halfway through, as you will need to bake the bread right away as soon as it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Spritz some water on top of the dough then put it in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. If the top starts to brown too much before time is up, cover with a piece of foil.</li>
        <li>Remove bread from oven and let cool slightly then gently remove from bread tin and transfer to a cooling rack. Let cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
